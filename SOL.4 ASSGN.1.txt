TAGS:------------------

Tags in HTML are being used to define the structure and layout of a webpages. Tags are referred to as the building blocks of HTML document. These are being defined within the angular brackets enclosing specific keywords. These tags provide instructions to web browsers on how to display the content on webpage. An HTML tag consists of an opening tag and in some cases, closing tag also. The opening tag consists of less than symbol (<) followed by the tag name and a greater than symbol (>). The closing tag is also the same but it includes slash (/) right after the less than symbol (<)

Way to write :

Opening Tag : <TAG_NAME>
Closing Tag : </TAG_NAME>

These are of 2 types:

1.Paired Tags or Container Tags:
These Tags are those tags which have both an opening and a closing tag and can contain other html elements and data within them. Eg: <HTML>-----</HTML>  ,  <HEAD>-----</HEAD> etc.

2.Singular Tag or void Tags:
These are also called as self closing tags because they dont require a closing tag. Eg: <hr> , <br> etc.
